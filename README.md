# OS-is-cooked-i-guess
I am unable to change my display brightness in this operating system [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS] 

I just recently dual booted Ubuntu with my primary Windows 11 OS . I cannot see option to change brightness , I have tried all GPT's/LLM s i know so far. Literally none of them helped me . Also I ll attach a screenshot of the taskbar and the settings window.

Device Description : 
  ASUS TUF A15 Gaming Laptop with AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Mobile 

My prediction : The Ubuntu OS is cooked with finding either to use Integrated AMD graphics or Nvidia's graphics. The default brightness is set to 1% , and i barely see the screen all the time.
