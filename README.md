# OS-is-cooked-i-guess
I am unable to change my display brightness in this operating system [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS] i just recently dual booted it with my primary Windows 11 OS . I cannot see option to change brightness , i have tried all GPT's/LLM s i know so far. Literally none of them helped me . Also I ll attach a screenshot of the taskbar and the settings window.
